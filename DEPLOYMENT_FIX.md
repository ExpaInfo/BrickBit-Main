# 🚨 Quick Deployment Fix

## The Issues:
1. **PHP Version Problem**: DigitalOcean was using an outdated PHP version
2. **Composer Script Failure**: Laravel's package discovery was failing during build

## ✅ Fixed Files Created:
- `build.sh` - Custom build script that handles the deployment properly
- `Procfile` - Tells DigitalOcean how to run your app
- `.nginx.conf` - Nginx configuration for Laravel
- Updated `composer.json` - Fixed failing scripts
- Updated `.do/app.yaml` - Specified PHP 8.1

## 🚀 Push These Fixes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment issues - PHP 8.1 and build scripts"
git push origin main
```

## 🔧 In DigitalOcean Dashboard:

1. **Go to your app settings**
2. **Add this environment variable:**
   ```
   PHP_VERSION=8.1
   ```

3. **Trigger a new deployment** (it should automatically deploy when you push)

## 🎯 Alternative: Manual Environment Variables

If the app spec isn't working, manually add these in the DigitalOcean dashboard:

### Build & Runtime:
```
PHP_VERSION=8.1
COMPOSER_ALLOW_SUPERUSER=1
```

### Your existing variables:
```
APP_NAME=BrickBit.net
APP_ENV=production
APP_KEY=base64:zz1Qkl2BYRacIZlksfSquJ5A+jbfEjCWc/cZzJ11iRk=
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=${APP_URL}
LOG_CHANNEL=stderr
```

## 🔍 If It Still Fails:

Check the build logs in DigitalOcean for:
1. PHP version being used
2. Composer install success
3. Storage directory creation

The build should now complete successfully! 🎉
